    "1. Don't forget to use tokenization!  This is important for good performance\n",
    "   but it is also the most expensive step.  Try vectorizing as a first initial\n",

    "   ```Python\n",
    "       X = feature_extraction.text \\\n",
    "                             .CountVectorizer() \\\n",

    "   ``` \n",
    "   and then running grid-serach and cross-validation only on of this\n",
    "   pre-processed data.  `CountVectorizer` has to memorize the mapping between\n",
    "   words and the index to which it is assigned.  This is linear in the size of\n",
    "   the vocabulary.  The `HashingVectorizer` does not have to remember this\n",
    "   mapping and will lead to much smaller models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try choosing different values for `min_df` (minimum document frequency\n",
    "   cutoff) and `max_df` in `CountVectorizer`.  Setting `min_df` to zero admits\n",
    "   rare words which might only appear once in the entire corpus.  This is both\n",
    "   prone to overfitting and makes your data unmanageably large.  Don't forget\n",
    "   to use cross-validation or to select the right value.  Notice that\n",
    "   `HashingVectorizer` doesn't support `min_df`  and `max_df`.  However, it's\n",
    "   not hard to roll your own transformer that solves for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try using `LinearRegression` or `RidgeCV`.  If the memory footprint is too\n",
    "   big, try switching to Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "   (`sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor`) You might find that even ordinary\n",
    "   linear regression fails due to the data size.  Don't forget to use\n",
